# 🚨 IMPORTANT: How to Deploy Your Website

## The Problem
You're seeing a blank page because GitHub Pages needs the actual website files from the `/app/frontend/build/` folder.

## ✅ THE SOLUTION (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Files
In Emergent, go to the file browser and navigate to:
```
/app/frontend/build/
```

You'll see:
- `index.html` ← Download this
- `static/` folder ← Download this entire folder
- `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.html` ← Open this for visual guide

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop:
   - The `index.html` file
   - The entire `static` folder (must keep folder structure!)
4. Commit the changes

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repo, go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main**
4. Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Wait & Visit
Wait 2-3 minutes, then visit:
```
https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/
```

## 📁 Required File Structure in GitHub
```
your-repo/
├── index.html
└── static/
    ├── css/
    │   └── main.b585a587.css
    └── js/
        └── main.beefced7.js
```

## 🔴 Common Mistakes
- ❌ Only uploading index.html without the static folder
- ❌ Uploading the source code instead of the build folder
- ❌ Not enabling GitHub Pages in settings
- ❌ Repository is set to Private (needs to be Public)

## ✅ What Should Happen
Once deployed correctly, you'll see:
- Beautiful hero section with photography background
- Navigation menu that works
- Team member cards
- Portfolio sections
- Working forms that email clickmedia28@gmail.com

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?
Open this file in your browser for a visual step-by-step guide:
```
/app/frontend/build/DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.html
```

## 💡 Quick Test
Before uploading to GitHub, you can test locally:
1. Download the build folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. You should see the full Click Media website
4. If you see the website, then uploading to GitHub will work!

**Remember:** The files in `/app/frontend/build/` are your complete, ready-to-deploy website. You need to upload THOSE files to GitHub, not the source code from `/app/frontend/src/`.
